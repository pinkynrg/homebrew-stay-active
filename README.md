# StayActive

**StayActive** is a simple utility script designed to keep Slack online and your Mac awake, even when youâ€™re away from your desk. It works by subtly moving the mouse cursor periodically to prevent your system from going idle.

## Features

- **Keeps Slack Online**: Prevents Slack from marking you as away.
- **Keeps Mac Awake**: Ensures your Mac doesn't go to sleep when you're away.

## Installation

You can install **StayActive** using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap pinkynrg/stay-active
brew install stay-active
```

> **Note:** This script relies on the `cliclick` tool, which will be installed automatically as a dependency.

## Usage

After installation, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
stay-active
```

This will start the script, which will continuously move the mouse cursor by a single pixel every second.

To stop the script, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## How It Works

The script runs an infinite loop, moving the mouse cursor by one pixel to the right and then one pixel to the left every second. This movement is subtle enough not to interfere with your work but ensures that Slack and your Mac remain active.
